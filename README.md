# Approach

| Notebook Section | Pipeline Step | How It Matches Our Data Pipeline Design | Key Concepts Showcased |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **1. Data Generation \& Loading** | Step 1: Data Ingestion | Generates sample nutrition data mimicking lab instruments and batch files. Demonstrates how raw data would enter the system. | Data ingestion simulation, handling streaming \& batch-like data |
| **2. Data Quality Assessment** | Step 3: Processing \& Quality Checks | Performs validation of data completeness, accuracy, and outliersâ€”matching our Silver layer's validation step. | Data quality, validation rules, anomaly detection basics (Great Expectations style) |
| **3. Visualization Dashboard** | Step 4: Analytics \& Dashboarding | Explores data visually using plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps. Similar to dashboards developed with QuickSight or Grafana. | Data exploration, visualization, insight communication |
| **4. Real-Time Anomaly Detection** | Step 6: Monitoring \& Alerting | Detects unusual patterns statistically on nutrition data streams, mimicking real-time alert logic in processing jobs or monitoring systems. | Real-time data monitoring, alert generation, anomaly detection |
| **5. Machine Learning Pipeline** | Step 7: Advanced Analytics \& ML | Builds and trains a ML model predicting nutrition quality scores to anticipate future quality issues, matching SageMaker / ML integrations. | Predictive modeling, ML workflow management, feature importance |
| **6. Pipeline Monitoring Dashboard** | Step 6: Monitoring \& Operational Health | Simulates pipeline metrics such as throughput, error rates, and data quality scores similar to CloudWatch and custom dashboards. | Pipeline health metrics, monitoring visualization, operational readiness |
| **7. Data Export \& Summary** | Step 5 \& Day-to-day Operations | Demonstrates exporting clean data and reports onto S3, closing the loop of data lifecycle management. | Data lifecycle, reporting, audit trail, data sharing |
